## 🛡️ Handling Judge Questions

### "What makes this unique?"
✅ "Professional-grade UI that rivals commercial products, intelligent alert system, and costs under ₹500 compared to ₹5000+ alternatives."

### "Can it scale?"
✅ "Absolutely! Modular architecture makes adding sensors trivial. Backend supports multiple devices, frontend adapts automatically."

### "What about reliability?"
✅ "Multiple layers: WebSocket for speed, REST API fallback, auto-reconnection, and clear status feedback."

### "Future plans?"
✅ "Database integration for long-term storage, machine learning for weather prediction, mobile app, and multi-sensor support."

### "Why offline?"
✅ "Agricultural areas often lack stable internet. Our system works completely offline, giving farmers reliable access to critical data."
